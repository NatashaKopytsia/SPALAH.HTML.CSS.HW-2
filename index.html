			<p>What Is the Boiling Point of Water?</p>
		</div>
			<div class="box answers">The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level). <p>However, the value is not a constant. The boiling point of water depends on the atmospheric pressure, which changes according to elevation. The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level), but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude (e.g., on a mountain) and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure (lived below sea level).</p>

			<p>Why Do Cats Sleep So Much?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box answers2">
			<p>Cats have the reputation for being aloof, and although it’s not an accurate assessment, some of that interpretation comes from the fact that cats are known for sleeping much of the day. Some people even label cats as lazy because sleeping takes up about two-thirds of their lives. Referring to cats as lazy is about as far from the truth as you can get.</p>
